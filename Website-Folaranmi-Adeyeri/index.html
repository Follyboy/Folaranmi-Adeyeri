      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>
        Folaranmi Adeyeri is a versatile data engineer and software developer with a strong foundation
        in backend systems, data analytics, and IT support. With hands-on experience spanning enterprise
        environments and public sector organizations, he thrives at the intersection of technology, problem-solving,
        and impactful data-driven solutions.<br/>
        Currently, Folaranmi works as a Data Engineer and IT Support Specialist at Premier Engineering Consultants in
        Kansas City, MO. There, he develops dynamic dashboards using Tableau and Power BI, equipping managers with
        actionable insights that support strategic decision-making. He’s also implemented A/B testing frameworks
        that led to a 15% uptick in conversion rates, and improved system performance through comprehensive updates
        and cleanup.<br/>
        In early 2024, he served as a Data Science Fellow at the World Bank Group, where he processed over 300GB of
        climate data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to uncover global climate trends. His contributions boosted model
        performance by 25% and ensured secure data handling via AWS S3. He also played a key role in team collaboration
        by managing version control through Git.<br/>
        From 2020 to 2022, Folaranmi was a Software Engineer at Midwestern Interactive, where he led backend development
        for web and mobile platforms. He consolidated microservices to reduce response time by 20%, designed and maintained
        over 100 RESTful API and GraphQL schemas, and optimized data flow with PostgreSQL and Docker. He also implemented
        CI/CD pipelines and automated testing to enhance code quality and deployment efficiency.<br/>
        His tech journey started as a Web Developer at Missouri Southern State University, where he enhanced the university
        library's website using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, improving mobile responsiveness and increasing user engagement
        by 20%.<br/>
        Outside of work, Folaranmi enjoys hiking scenic trails, traveling to new destinations, and playing Call of
        Duty—activities that fuel his love for strategy, exploration, and fast-paced challenges.
