      <h1 style="text-align: center">Biography - Missouri Southern State University Chapter</h1>
      <p>
        My journey into the world of technology and software development began at <strong>Missouri Southern State University (MSSU)</strong>, where I pursued a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Science</strong>. This formative period was not just about attending lectures, it was where I laid the foundation for the career I have today, blending structured learning with real-world application.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from MSSU with <strong>Summa Cum Laude</strong> honors and was proudly named the <strong>Most Outstanding Graduate</strong> in my department. These accolades reflected my deep commitment to academic excellence and active engagement with the material beyond just coursework.

      </div>
        At MSSU, I immersed myself in a curriculum designed to equip students with the core competencies of modern computing. I gained hands-on experience with programming languages and tools that form the backbone of many enterprise and consumer-facing applications today. <strong>C#</strong> became one of my strongest tools, enabling me to understand object-oriented programming and build desktop and server-side applications. I also learned to design and structure websites using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, and added interactivity through <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which gave me a full-stack perspective early in my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        What made my time at MSSU especially unique was the balance between traditional academics and practical experience. One of the highlights was working with <strong>Swift</strong>, where I explored mobile development and got a glimpse into iOS application programming. I also took the opportunity to understand <strong>Bash scripting</strong>, which introduced me to Unix-based systems, automation, and systems-level operations. Additionally, I became familiar with <strong>RPG (Report Program Generator)</strong>, a language still used in many legacy systems and enterprise environments, giving me a broad view of both modern and traditional development paradigms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of classwork, I landed my <strong>first job in tech at MSSU itself</strong>, serving as a <strong>Web Developer for the university’s library</strong>. This role was a pivotal experience that cemented my passion for front-end development and content management. My responsibilities included building and maintaining web pages using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, ensuring content was accessible, functional, and user-friendly for students and faculty. I also worked extensively with content management systems, particularly <strong>LibGuides</strong>, which is widely used in academic libraries. This experience improved my technical proficiency and also taught me the importance of design thinking, user experience, and content strategy, skills that continue to serve me well today.
      </p>
      <p>
        My time at MSSU was more than just academic achievement; it was a time of personal and professional growth. I learned how to troubleshoot problems, adapt to new technologies, and communicate technical ideas clearly, both in code and conversation. The hands-on projects, collaborative environment, and early exposure to real-world tools gave me a strong launchpad into the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, when I reflect on my path, MSSU stands out as the place where it all started. The combination of a strong curriculum, practical opportunities, and a supportive environment shaped me into the developer I am today.

      <h1 style="text-align: center">Biography - George Washington University Chapter</h1>
      <p>
        After spending nearly three years working professionally as a Software Engineer at <strong>Midwestern Interactive</strong>, I made the decision to deepen my technical skill set and pivot toward advanced analytics and data-driven solutions. This led me to pursue a <strong>Master’s degree in Data Science</strong> at <strong>George Washington University (GWU)</strong>, a program that challenged and expanded both my technical capabilities and problem-solving perspective.
      </p>

        </div>
        My time at GWU was marked by hands-on, interdisciplinary learning. I gained extensive experience with key tools in the data science ecosystem, including <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>Dash</strong> for interactive data visualization. I also developed cloud computing proficiency through work with <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong>, which prepared me to deploy models and applications in scalable environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        A defining highlight of my graduate journey was the opportunity to serve as a <strong>Data Science Fellow at the World Bank Group</strong>. In this role, I worked on real-world projects that supported international development goals and informed data-driven policy decisions. I was able to apply the skills I was developing in the classroom to practical, high-impact initiatives involving climate finance and global sustainability efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recognition of my academic excellence and international perspective, I was selected as a recipient of GW’s prestigious <strong>Global Leaders Award</strong>. This merit-based, renewable tuition award is granted to outstanding international students who demonstrate exceptional academic promise and a commitment to contributing to a diverse, global learning environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My time at GWU was more than an academic experience—it was a transformation. It sharpened my analytical mindset, broadened my global outlook, and empowered me to take on complex challenges with confidence. The combination of rigorous coursework, real-world experience, and a strong network of mentors and peers made GWU a turning point in my professional journey.
